## Recommendations

### Leak Detection
- Investigate sensors with the highest number of detected leak events
- Deploy maintenance teams to areas with consistent pressure anomalies
- Optimize pressure thresholds for more accurate leak detection

### Water Consumption
- Adjust water supply during peak usage times identified in the analysis
- Develop targeted conservation measures for high-consumption periods
- Consider implementing time-of-day pricing based on usage patterns

### Early Warning System
- Implement automated alerts based on the early warning thresholds
- Focus monitoring resources on sensors with high warning rates
- Consider decreasing response time thresholds for critical areas

### Anomaly Detection
- Investigate recurring anomalies for potential system design issues
- Develop machine learning models to improve anomaly prediction
- Create a centralized dashboard for real-time anomaly monitoring

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the value of integrating multiple analytical approaches to water leakage detection. By combining leak detection, consumption pattern analysis, early warning systems, and anomaly detection, we can develop a robust framework for identifying and preventing water leaks while optimizing resource management.

The results show that with proper data analysis and monitoring, it is possible to detect leaks early, predict consumption patterns, and identify anomalies that may indicate system issues before they become critical problems.
