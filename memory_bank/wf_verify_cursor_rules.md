# Workflow: Verify Cursor Rules

## Current tasks from user prompt
- Verify cursor rules are properly set up and working in the project
- Ensure the workflow system is functioning according to the defined rules

## Plan (simple)
1. Examine existing cursor rules structure in the .cursor/rules directory
2. Check if the workflow_rules.mdc file is correctly formatted and contains valid instructions
3. Verify if memory_bank directory is properly set up for storing workflow files
4. Create a test workflow file to demonstrate the system is working
5. Provide recommendations for any improvements or fixes needed

## Steps
1. Check .cursor directory structure
2. Read the workflow_rules.mdc file to understand the rules
3. Check memory_bank directory for existing workflow files
4. Create this workflow file to document the verification process
5. Test if the workflow system functions properly
6. Provide recommendations for improvements

## Things done
- Examined .cursor directory structure and found rules directory
- Read workflow_rules.mdc file and understood the workflow system requirements
- Checked memory_bank directory for existing workflow files
- Created this workflow file (wf_verify_cursor_rules.md) to document the process

## Things not done yet
